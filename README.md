# _Made for Leavers_ - README.md
The project is called _Made for Leavers_ as it is made for prospective students, mostly school leavers, who are looking to leave their country or city to study. Thus, the one primary objective of this project is to provide a website that helps prospective students find their right university in their right country or city. This one primary objective is achieved by the successful implementation of this project’s two secondary objectives. Firstly, _Made for Leavers_ is a centralised universities hub that takes a user’s input of a country or city and outputs all the universities in that country or city as clickable links to their websites, which can be saved, loaded, and removed from a database. Secondly, _Made for Leavers_ has a Ninja AI system embedded into _Made for Leavers_ that acts as a quasi-guidance counsellor to prospective students. The API/AI of the Hipo Labs API and the Ninja AI help prospective students find their right university in their right country or city.
